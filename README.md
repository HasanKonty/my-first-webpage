this is gonna be the first webpage i create from scratch. 
hoping to be able to do it.


the more i work on it the more i realise the stuff that i don't know... hoping that's something good.


first obstacle is the random information section... easy easy isA.

in the process i am having a better grasp of the flex-basis


my eyes are seeing stuff that they were blind to before...

this is rewarding indeed, i dont care if this journey ends in a job or not... i am having fun indeed.

this is turnign out to be a reflection session rahter thatn a README lol...

anyhoe i just discovered that stressing and grinding isn't the key... clear mind and taking it easy is helping indeed...


um wondering when should i commit my changes... um commiting now anyhow...

i decided to commit and push everytime i feel bored and want to take some time off...


after finishing... the things i learned 
-how to use border radoius
-how to decorate links
-how to style buttons


i kinda feel a bit more confident and optimistic.... i know this means i am just begining and i know nothing... i guess patience is the key...
